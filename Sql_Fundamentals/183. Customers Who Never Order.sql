+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| customerId  | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
customerId is a foreign key (reference columns) of the ID from the Customers table.

Write a solution to find all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Customers table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Orders table:
+----+------------+
| id | customerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Output: 
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+

-- here we care about customer who never order anything 
-- so we will use left join to get all customer and their order if any 
-- and then will filter out those ones who have never order (order id is null)

SELECT c.name AS Customers
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.id = o.customerId
WHERE o.id IS NULL 
order by c.name;

-- another approach using not in
SELECT name AS Customers
FROM Customers
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT customerId FROM Orders)
order by name;
