Explanation: 
According to orders 3 and 4 in the Orders table, it is easy to tell that only salesperson John and Pam have sales to company RED, so we report all the other names in the table salesperson.


Logic : 

// We select the names of salespersons from the SalesPerson table
// We use a WHERE clause to filter out those salespersons whose names are present in a sub

-- THE NESTED QUERY TO FETCH SALESPEOPLE WHO HAVE ORDERS WITH COMPANY 'RED'
-- THE OUTER QUERY TO FETCH SALESPEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN THE ABOVE LIST


select sp.name 
from SalesPerson sp 
where sp.name not in(
    select sp2.name 
    from SalesPerson sp2 
    join Orders o on sp2.sales_id = o.sales_id 
    join Company c on o.com_id = c.com_id 
    where c.name = 'RED'
)

-- THE NESTED QUERY EXPLANATION :
// We select the names of salespersons from the SalesPerson table (aliased as sp2
// We join the Orders table (aliased as o) on sales_id to get the orders made by each salesperson
// We join the Company table (aliased as c) on com_id to get the company
// We filter the results to only include those where the company name is 'RED'
-- THE OUTER QUERY EXPLANATION :
// We select the names of salespersons from the SalesPerson table (aliased as sp)
// We filter the results to only include those whose names are not in the list of names returned by the nested query

-- Another approach using LEFT JOIN and IS NULL
select sp.name
from SalesPerson sp
left join Orders o on sp.sales_id = o.sales_id
left join Company c on o.com_id = c.com_id and c.name = 'RED'
where c.com_id IS NULL;
