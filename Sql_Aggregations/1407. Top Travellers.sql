Table: Users

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
name is the name of the user.
 

Table: Rides

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| user_id       | int     |
| distance      | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
user_id is the id of the user who traveled the distance "distance".
 

Write a solution to report the distance traveled by each user.

Return the result table ordered by travelled_distance in descending order, if two or more users traveled the same distance, order them by their name in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Users table:
+------+-----------+
| id   | name      |
+------+-----------+
| 1    | Alice     |
| 2    | Bob       |
| 3    | Alex      |
| 4    | Donald    |
| 7    | Lee       |
| 13   | Jonathan  |
| 19   | Elvis     |
+------+-----------+
Rides table:
+------+----------+----------+
| id   | user_id  | distance |
+------+----------+----------+
| 1    | 1        | 120      |
| 2    | 2        | 317      |
| 3    | 3        | 222      |
| 4    | 7        | 100      |
| 5    | 13       | 312      |
| 6    | 19       | 50       |
| 7    | 7        | 120      |
| 8    | 19       | 400      |
| 9    | 7        | 230      |
+------+----------+----------+
Output: 
+----------+--------------------+
| name     | travelled_distance |
+----------+--------------------+
| Elvis    | 450                |
| Lee      | 450                |
| Bob      | 317                |
| Jonathan | 312                |
| Alex     | 222                |
| Alice    | 120                |
| Donald   | 0                  |
+----------+--------------------+
Explanation: 
Elvis and Lee traveled 450 miles, Elvis is the top traveler as his name is alphabetically smaller than Lee.
Bob, Jonathan, Alex, and Alice have only one ride and we just order them by the total distances of the ride.
Donald did not have any rides, the distance traveled by him is 0.

SELECT u.name,
       IFNULL(SUM(r.distance), 0) AS travelled_distance
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN Rides r ON u.id = r.user_id
GROUP BY u.id, u.name
ORDER BY travelled_distance DESC, u.name ASC;
-- We use LEFT JOIN to include all users even those without rides
-- IFNULL is used to convert NULL distances to 0 for users without rides
-- We group by user id and name to calculate total distance per user
-- Finally, we order the result by travelled_distance in descending order and name in ascending order

-- HERE NOTE : ORDER BY WORKS FROM LEFT -> RIGHT 
--  HERE IT WILL FIRST SORT BY TRAVALLED_DISTANCE HIGHEST TO LOWEST 
-- AND IF THE SAME NAME APPEARS SORT IT BY NAME IN ASCENDING ORDER


-- New Concept 

-- IFNULL FUNCTION :
-- The IFNULL function in SQL is used to replace NULL values with a specified value.
-- Syntax: IFNULL(expression, replacement_value)
-- Example: SELECT IFNULL(column_name, 0) FROM table_name
-- In this example, if column_name contains NULL, it will be replaced with 0 in the result set.
